 I made my webapp using basic web development techniques that is accessible and understandable to everyone. I used htms css js for frontend and node js for backend.

 and has features like :
-Once logged in no relogging to save time 
-brute force attacks prevention
-breached password detection 
-suspicious ip throttling
 -Dark mode and light mode for user experience 
-Room id system using uuid 
-Name option for videochat (using sockets and uuid)
-Vc=webrtc 
-Connection  = web sockets
-Doodle board
-Third party screen recording service
-chat time using the moment node js library
-simple loging using pino library fast in node js platform and easy to use
